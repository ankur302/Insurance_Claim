# Insurance_Claim
This project was a part of bootcamp organised by dPhi. This is basically a classification problem where we have to build a model that would predict if a person travelling 
would claim his/her insurance based on certain features.
This is a classic example of imbalance dataset set and in this project I tried to handle this issue using SMOTE. 
I would be improving this project as I learn more and more about various ML techniques.
